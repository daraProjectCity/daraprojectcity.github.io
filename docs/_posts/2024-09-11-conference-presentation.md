At the Computer Graphics and Visual Computing Conference ([CGVC](https://cgvc.org.uk/CGVC2024/)) held at City St George's, University of London, Steph presented project Dara as part of a panel of the six successfully funded EPSRC projects on _Human-centred decision-making_.

Niamh presented our early work in the form a poster (above). See these [further details](https://gicentre.org/cgvc24/paper1044_CRC.pdf).

The following week Niamh will present our work at the annual [British Aphasiology Society (BAS)](https://www.bas.org.uk) conference.

Together these two conference presentations are important to the project because they help to link two previously separate academic communities â€“ research into visualization design and research into language disability.
