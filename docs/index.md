## Our Aims

- To understand how people with language disabilities use data visualization in decision-making and the challenges they face.

- To produce better data visualization design guidelines and tools for people with language disabilities.

## Our Approach

- We run in-depth studies to investigate how people use and experience data visualization for everyday decision-making.

- We want to know what works well, what barriers people face, and what workarounds they adopt.

- We use this knowledge in co-creation to design and test new, inclusive approaches to visualisation

## Our Motivation

- Accessibility research in data visualization has previously considered the needs of people with visual impairments and learning disabilities, but has not explored the needs of people with language disabilities.

- We want to lead the way in expanding ideas of accessibility in data visualization to include adults with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and aphasia
